# Sales-Overview-Dashboard
I have made an interactive Power BI Sales Dashboard to track and analyze sales data.
Firstly the Data cleaning and ETL process is done as per the requriments, DAX was used for creating the Revenue and Sales-Quantity column.
When  the calculations is done, I have made visualizations and create a dashboard using card, bar chart, line chart, donut chart and slicer.
