# Sales-Overview-Dashboard
* In this project, I have made an interactive POWER BI Sales Dashboard to track and analyze sales data.
* Firstly the data cleaning and ETL process is done as per the requirements, DAX was used for creating the Revenue and sales-quantity column.
* When the calculations are done, I have made visualizations and create a dashboard using card, bar chart, line chart, donut chart and slicer.
* With the help of this we can see revenue, total sales-quantity, revenue by city, sales-quantiy by markets, revenue trend, top 5 customer, revenue by zone and also we can see the results in particular year and particular month.
* I have also created Mobile Layout of this dashboard.

* I learned about this project from the Code Basics YouTube channel : [codebasics](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uva8pk1FI3iK9kCOKQdz1I9)
